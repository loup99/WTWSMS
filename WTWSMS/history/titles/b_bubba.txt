### This is a temple holding for Anxhi. Right now, the Root West Holy Site permanently lacks a temple because of the way the AI elects to build Castles and Cities before Temples. This makes it impossible to Reform the Root West religion instantly, instead requiring its MA to be raised. I am fixing this error now. ###
