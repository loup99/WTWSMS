this_is_sparta.1_TITLE;This... is... SPARTA!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
this_is_sparta.2;We are Spartans. Centuries of Christianization have made us soft. Our heritage is swamped under the foreign monotheism of a dead Jew. Our gods are burnt and spit on./n NO MORE!! We are now in a position to ressurect the great state of Sparta, and the beauty of its warriors and martial prowess. As one united front, nothing can stop us. Let us cry together, as one united Spartan nation: THIS, IS, SPARTA!!!!
this_is_sparta.3;-AND FOREVER MORE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

this_is_sparta.9;A new age has begun! The spirit of those three hundred patriots who stalled the Persians at Thermopylae remains in every Spartan heart! Our finest warriors stand at the ready to reestablish Sparta as a preeminent force on the earth! What can stop us? Who can stop us? THIS IS SPARTA!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
this_is_sparta.10;We have received word from Sparta. Apparently, a foreigner has taken the Spartan throne, and he holds no allegiance to Spartan society, nor does he have Spartan citizenship. With no backing behind Sparta, the state has fallen into disarray. In its place stands Hellenes: the land of the Greeks. While this may not neccesarily be the end of Sparta's rennaisance, it can certainly be said that the age of Sparta has once again passed into history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
this_is_sparta.11;A legend fades...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
this_is_sparta.12;To think they thought the had a chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
this_is_sparta.13;Since your embracement of a modern religion, you have begun to think long and hard about your Spartan lifestyle. While glory and honor are great things, a society based entirely on that, with no substance and little civilization, strikes you as odd. While you may still be a great warrior, unfortunately, you are no longer a true Spartan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

this_is_not_sparta_desc;This Spartan character is a "Trembler", a craven and a coward. This makes him an anathema to every righteous Spartan alive, and is one of the only ways to lose Spartan citizenship. Until they can man up, this character has been excluded from Spartan society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
inferior_spartan_child;Challenged Child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
inferior_spartan_child_desc;This Spartan infant was born with a phsyical or mental defect. Per Spartan custom, he or she is to be laid on a hill for dead to test his or her will to live. Should they survive or roll down the hill, they will be welcomed back to Spartan society with open arms, as one of the many artists and civilian administrators of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spartan_warrior;Spartan Hoplite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spartan_warrior_desc;This Spartan character is primed and ready for battle. He has come of age and has completed his war training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lame_spartan;Lame Spartan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lame_spartan_desc;By virtue of being born a Spartan and showing bravery in the will to live, this character has proven their worthiness to hold Spartan citizenship despite their inability to fight. They will instead provide auxillary tasks for the betterment of Spartan society, such as artistry, farming, teaching, and the like. As he or she does not have to focus on the rigors of Spartan training, he or she has directed his or her Spartan work ethic and drive elsewhere, to other skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
