root_west_pagan_DESC;The Root West religion is an ancient, shamanistic faith native to the Tangut peoples. While some Tanguts converted to Buddhism over time, many rural Tanguts clinged to this ancient religion devoted to the worship of cranes and monkeys. Root West rulers are called 'The Red Faced' or 'Redface', and are believed to descend from monkeys, or to have been granted the right to rule by them. Root West clergymen are called the Black Headed, due to their black robes and black felt hats. They perform an intercessory role between the Red Faced and the gods and exercise control over over the people faith's orthodoxy.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

root_west_pagan_reformed_DESC;After centuries of syncretization and being eaten away by the Buddhist faith, a charismatic Redface has united the disparate Root West shamans under one authority! Worship of cranes and monkeys, use and depiction of clergy vestments, and other aspects of faith have been standardized, and the myriad of musicals, sonnets, and odes of worship, along with the defenitive Great Ode, have been combined into one universal hymnal. A central liturgy now exists for each holy animal and sacrament. The powerful Black Headed clergy have always exercised intercession and excommunication duties among Root West settlements, but now a centralized Black Intercessor excercises authority over all the Redfaced and worshippers everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;x
