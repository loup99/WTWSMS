EVTDESC_saxon_1;The hordes of Germanic invaders have finally breached the mighty fortress of Deva Victrix. This town, built by the Legio II Adiotrix, was much larger than any other Roman city in Britannia. Originally intended to be the center of the invasion of Ireland, this fortress then was planned to be the capital of Britannia. With the removal of the legions, the Britons continued to uphold this ancient city. Now, the invaders are referring to this land as Legacaestir, or City of the Legions. It seems that the fall of the Britons is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_saxon_1;A Black Day!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_saxon_1;Wondrous Fate!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC40076589;While sailing with your men, you have encountered a great storm. Many are in despair, and they look to you for safety.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA40076589;Save yourself!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB76589;Take control of the situation!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC40076591;A villager has come to your court, claiming that he saw a magical creature in the woods. Surely such creatures don't actually exist?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA40076591;Bah! Fairy Tales...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB40076591;This is incredible! Tell me more...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC40076591;Of course they are real!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHRE.3;With the Crowning of the Holy Roman Emperor, tensions between the East and West Churches have reached a climax. The Ecumenical Patriarch claims that the crowning of a Western Emperor was unlawful, for Odoacer had already given the Crown of the West to the Eastern Emperor Zeno. Now, both church leaders excommunicated each other, leading to a Schism. IT is now up to each ruler to choose their loyalties.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHRE.3;The Great Schism;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHRE.3;Tensions in the Church;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHRE.3;I stand with the Patriarchs!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHRE.3;I stand with Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHRE.1;Tensions Rising;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHRE.1;With your crowning as Holy Roman Emperor, tensions have reached a climax between the East and West Churches. It seems there is a state of Schism between the two Empires, and respectively, Chalcedonian Christianity has been divided into Catholicism, centered on Rome, and Orthodoxy, centered in Constantinople. This shall show to which Empire loyalties lay.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHRE.1;Glory to the Pope!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.1;Another one of my schemes backfired on me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.1;Back to the drawing board.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.2;You are delighted as another one of your courtroom schemes goes off perfectly, truly you have earned your reputation as an elusive shadow in the court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.2;It's a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.3;You looked like a fool as a diplomat tricked you into that bad deal. Are you really that naive?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.3;I'll do better next time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.4;Everyone left the meeting content, unknowing that it was you who ended up on top at the end. Truly you have earned your reputation as a grey eminence in the court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.4;Golden Tounge...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.5;Your accounts have been terrible, and it seems you are no longer able to blame the math, you're an indulgent wastrel.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.5;But my stuff...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.6;Your every venture is profitable, and you grand income has started a rumor in the court that you are actually Midas touched.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.6;I have the Golden Touch!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.7;You had thought it had been mathematics errors, but it seems that your spouse has been spending large amounts of your treasury on clothing and jewels.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.7;Demand she stop her decadent ways!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBENLIL.7;It's not hurting anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.8;You've been so stressed lately, and today you snapped at your spouse, even though nothing was really wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.8;No! Wait!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.9;You've found that you have little motivation to do anything anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.9;Sigh...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.11;You've had another one of your "episodes" today at court. Though everyone looked away, you could tell they were horrified.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.11;I can't help it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.12;You sneezed on a courtier today, and he made quite a fuss about it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.12;Excuse me...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.13;You seem to be forgetting the names of your Courtiers, and you even called your chancellor Swarticke Cloppenburg!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.13;Who are you again?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.14;After a night of drinking, you start heading down the stairs when you trip.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.14;Ahhhhhhh!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.15;The people look at you in awe, children want to be you when they grow up, you are a Crusader, and have the scars to prove it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.15;Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.16;Just because of your birth, people treat you as some sort of lower person. It's not like it was your choice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.16;Who cares what they think!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.17;Your Court Chaplain has been a lot colder to you since your excommunication, it seems this has turned him against you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.17;Zealous fool...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.18;Ever since that nasty incident involving a family member, your court has been quite unforgiving, and the rumors that are spread are quite shocking to say the least.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.18;It was coming..;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.19;When the visiting dignitaries came to court, they could hardly contain the suppressed laughter.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.19;I don't think it is funny!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.20;Once again your lisp has gotten in the proceedings of the court, after speaking to the assembled group, you weren't sure they understood you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.20;Well this is embarrassing..;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.21;While you were talking to your men, you had a horrible case of stutters.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.21;How embarrassing;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.22;You are the most beautiful person in court, and quite desired by the opposite sex. Today, a foreign diplomat complimented your beauty for quite a while until you asked him to stop.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.22;I'm wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.24;You servants found you passed out drunk in another bar today, and you made quite a scene when taking you back to your chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.24;I don't remember...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.23;A painter has came to your castle, and wishes to paint many pictures of you, claiming your incredible good looks as perfect inspiration.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.23;But of course...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBENLIL.23;Pride is a sin.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.25;Your court members refuse to look at you, and you can hear their comments behind your back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.25;How could they!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.26;You were feasting one night and you needed a servant to lift you up to the table.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.26;How embarrassing..;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.27;A child mistook you for another child today, and even though his mother made him apologize, it still hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.28;Today you solved a variety of mental games with your courtiers, amazing them with your superior intellect.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.28;I'm a pretty smart person!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.29;You have been advising your steward in all manners of work, until he finally yelled at you, and told you to keep your ideas to yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.29;It's not my fault I'm so smart.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.30;An ambassador from §Y$ENEMY$§! came offering all kinds of promises of peace, but luckily, thanks to your quick wit, you saw through them all, and threw the man out.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.30;And stay out!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCENLIL.31;Your quick wit is the envy of the court, and your subjects always look to you for advice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAENLIL.31;I'm pretty great.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHRE.3;The fools...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHRE.3;My Christians may align with Rome...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHRE.3;My Christians may align with Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFRANKS.1;With the death of the Frankish King, the kingdom of the Franks has dissolved.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFRANKS.1;Such a Shame...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCspanish.1;You have recently established an Inquisition for your realm, in the hopes of seeking our heresy. Your Inquisition may take extreme measures to enforce your faith in the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCspanish.2;Your liege has recently established an inquisition in the hopes at rooting out Infidels and Heretics. Things can only get worse from here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAspanish.1;Go forth!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAspanish.2;I've got a bad feeling.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCspanish.3;As high inquisitor, you have noticed that one of your lieges vassals is employing a dirty heretic. Something must be done at once.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCspanish.4;I am most concerned that you allow heretics as your advisors. They should immediately be removed from position their position.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAspanish.4;I have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBspanish.4;I'd sooner die!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtyr.1;Your liege has recently put you under suspicion of being an enemy of the state. Such claims are clearly unfounded, but with the state the nation is in, you need to be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtyr.1;Confess!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtyr.2;You agents have put one of your vassals under questioning, and he immediately confesses. What action do you want to take?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtyr.2;Let it slide...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtyr.2;Have the vassal arrested!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtyr.4;With your confession, your liege has ordered your immediate arrest. Let's hope worse does not happen in the dungeons.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtyr.4;Uh oh...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtyr.5;Your liege, in an unforeseen act of kindness, has decided to forget about your confession. Let's hope this does not happen again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtyr.5;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtyr.6;Wonderful liege! I have received news that you have decided to spare me! I thank you endlessly for your kindness, and I swear total loyalty!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtyr.6;Excellent...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtyr.7;Your agents report that one of your vassals, who is clearly plotting against you, has denied all charges against him. It is obvious he is lying, and is a danger to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCtyr.7;I'll spare them...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtyr.7;Beat it out of them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDtyr.7;I do as the voices command.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtyr.8;In an act of incredible mercy, I have decided to spare your life. I will not make this decision again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtyr.9;Thugs from your liege have come, they threaten to force a confession out of you. You now have a choice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtyr.1;I've done nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMESENATE.21;The Republic Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSENATE.21;With the supremacy of the Senate, now all lands it controls are now rightful possessions of the restored republic.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTASENATE.21;Long live S.P.Q.R.!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_guard_3100;The Scholae Palatinae;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3100;With the recent dangers to being an Emperor of the East, it has become necessary to provide a better guard for your safety. Named the Scholae Palatinae, this elite corps of soldiers will ensure the Emperor will never fear again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3100;Long live the order!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3101;[From.GetFirstName], the Emperor of the East, has formed a new guard, the Scholae Palatinae to better protect imperial interests. This elite corps has the potential of granting great prestige and honor, and many young men are joining it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3101;Interesting developments...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3110;I won't allow it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3110;Your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has decided that he wants to enlist in the noble Scholae Palatinae. There is a good chance of prestige and glory, but he may not come back alive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_guard_3110;Let him go;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3112;A grizzled old warrior having just returned from Greece arrived with a message from [From.GetTitledFirstName] today. Though he has left the Scholae Palatinae, your son has apparently found himself a Greek wife and decided to remain in Constantinople and build a new life there. It is doubtful whether you will ever see him again...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3112;My son....;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3113;After finishing his service with the Scholae Palatinae, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has married a local woman and decided to remain in Constantinople instead of returning home to the barbaric land he once came from. He has pledged his continued service to you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3113;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3115;A heavily scarred warrior clad in Greek armor approaches your throne, and before he can be disarmed, the stranger relieves your guard of his spear in a swift, fluid motion and tosses it aside. Other guards hurry forward, but you raise your hand to stop them. The stranger is [From.GetTitledFirstName], at last returned from Greece!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3115;[From.GetFirstName]! You've... changed!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3117;Your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has finally returned home from Greece and his service with the Scholae Palatinae! Although you can't quite put your finger on it, he seems different somehow... and what is this Greek love he speaks of?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3117;No matter, I'm just glad he made it home!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3119;A frail, robed man is led into your throne room, and your guards explain that he just arrived on a ship coming from Constantinople. The man would only speak your name over and over again, and so he was brought to you. To your horror, you recognize him at last as [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3119;My son! What has happened!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3121;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally returned home after a long and successful career in the Scholae Palatinae! He fought in several battles, and learned much from the clever strategies and tactics favored by both the Greeks and their enemies in Persia.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3121;Tell me of your battles, [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3123;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from Greece and the Scholae Palatinae, but he refuses to speak of his experiences there. You know he took part in several battles and killed many foes, but instead of reveling in the glory of his accomplishments, [From.GetFirstName] is plagued by nightmares and jumps at sudden sounds.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3123;Strange...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3125;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from the Eastern Empire and his service with the Scholae Palatinae, but he is not alone. He has found a Greek wife and brought her with him. She is not familiar with our customs or language, and the climate does not seem to agree with her, but she seems willing to make the best of her new home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3125;Welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3127;After many years in Greece, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally been released from his service to the Scholae Palatinae and returned home. Your son is a changed man, however. The old gods no longer hold any interest for him, and he instead speaks incessantly of Christendom and the horrors that await those who refuse to convert...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3127;May the gods have mercy...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3129;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from the Eastern Empire and the Scholae Palatinae as a changed man. He is wiser, more confident in his own abilities and more knowledgeable in matters of war. It seems the time spent in Greece did him good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3129;Welcome home, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3131;Several former Scholians have recently returned home after serving the Eastern Emperor, and they bring news most grave. Your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], fell in battle while campaigning in the East. They assure you that he faced his enemy with bravery and slew many before their numbers overwhelmed him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3131;He died a hero...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3133;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has at last returned from Greece on a ship filled with the spoils of war! Apparently the great Emperor is generous to those who serve him well, and there is gold here from all over the Greek realm, the Orient and beyond. Your son insists on sharing these riches with you, his loving father.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3133;[From.GetFirstName], you make me proud!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_3134;Upon learning of the death of your father, you left the Scholae Palatinae and departed Greece for home on a ship filled with loot from your campaigns in the Orient. It was a long and perilous journey back, but your feet are now firmly planted on the soil of the land that is your birthright. The throne is yours.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_3134;It is as I remember it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_guard_31001;The Excubitors;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_31001;With the recent dangers to being an Emperor of the East, it has become necessary to provide a better guard for your safety. Named the Excubitors, this elite corps of soldiers will ensure the Emperor will never fear again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_guard_31001;Long live the order!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_guard_31011;[From.GetFirstName], the Emperor of the East, has formed a new guard, the Excubitors to better protect imperial interests. This elite corps has the potential of granting great prestige and honor, and many young men are joining it.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAGOG_36;Praise Lugh!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGOG_38;We are now preparing to hold the Samhainm or All Hallow's Eve, the holy tradition commemorating the beginning of winter. In these last warm days, the merchants are setting up their stalls, and the children are dressing up a monsters. This is a time of feasting and celebration, for at this time the veil of Skathach is thin, allowing spirits to cross over.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_DONA_1;The True Church Rising;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DONA_1;After years of persecution and hiding, the Donatist faith has regained enough followers and power to declare the recreation of the Bishopric of Carthage. Now, with the Bishop back in his seat of power, he may properly identify those who are fitting of the Lapsi, and declare a Great Matyr War to expel Heathens, and even worse, the Traditores.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_DONA_2;The Agonisticis;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DONA_2;With the Donatist faith once again in control of its holy sites, it has become necessary to re-found the sacred order of the Agonisticis. Known as the Circumcellions by the heretics, this order of Martyrs will defend the faith from those who would put it into jeopardy Already thousands of young men are joining the ranks of the Agonisticis. This is the new golden age of Donatism.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DONA_2;Laudate Deum!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_402620;I trust you are in good health, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. My name is Halmsaurg, and I have taken it upon myself to create a brotherhood of warriors devoted to Loki.

EVTOPTA_GOG_2002;But what of Russian values?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOG_2002;They are coming around.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMESOS.1;Syria Restored!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSOS.1;After many years of brutal war, loss of life, and rending of families, the gateway to the East is Restored. Soissons has come far from its holdings in Gaul. Already, the Legions are preparing their tactics and weapons for further conquest in the East.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMESOS.2;Aegyptus Restored!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSOS.2;The people of Soissons are once again Triumphant. After a many brutal sieges, the great Province of Aegyptus has been captured by its true legitimate owners. Now, the Breadbasket of the world will go to feeding the extensive lands of the Roman people.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMESOS.3;Cyrenaica Restored!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSOS.3;The cheering of people echo through this barren stretch of land, with the banners of Soissons finally flying over the cities. With this province restored, Soissons is much closer to restoring the empire that is rightfully its own.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMESOS.4;Africa Restored!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSOS.4;Finally, Africa has been restored to the claimants of the Western Empire. After its loss to the Vandals in times pass, the people of Soissons proved much stronger than before.

EVTDESCSOS.7;Soissons has just made its first steps into the old empire, finally restoring the old province of Gaul. Banners and crowds are gathered in Novidunum to cheer on their Rex.

EVTNAMESOS.8;Germania Captured!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSOS.8;At long last, the province of Germania has been added to the Roman's land.

EVTNAMESOS.9;Britannia Restored!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSOS.9;Once again, Roman legions are protecting the people of Britannia.

Now, wealthy landowners are purchasing British land and building elaborate estates.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMESOS.10;Hispania Restored!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSOS.10;At last, Hispania has been restored to Soissons. After the barbaric Visigoths sacked Rome, they carved their wretched kingdom out of Roman lands. At last, the people have been liberated from the chains, and now cheer for the true owners of Hispania, Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSOS.14;The island of Hibernia is the latest addition to the ever-expanding domains of the Roman Empire. This land of gently rolling hills and green fields was never conquered by the old empire, but it should become a pleasant fief to govern if one does not mind the rain or the foul-smelling Celts who inhabit it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMESOS.14;Hibernia Captured;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMESOS.40;Soissons Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSOS.40;At last, the Roman Empire's territories are completely restored. ;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTALoR.222210;Those blasphemous heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.222211;The Great Schism;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.222211;With the Crowning of the Holy Roman Emperor, the divisions between the Patriarch of Rome and the others has been dwindling. Now, both groups can no longer consider each other members one religion. Now you must decide who is right in this theological debate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.222211;For the Orthodoxy!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.222211;For the Pope!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLoR.222211;Perhaps the Arians were onto something...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2CONS;The Second Council of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2CONS;An important decision lays upon you today, the Three-Chapter controversy has come to full storm, and the massive growth of Nestorianism is endangering the Patriarchy. Now, a decision must be made. By condemning the Nestorians, and supporting the Monophysite viewpoint, you can bring the Monophysites back into Chalcedonian Christianity, but be careful, the Patriarch of Rome may disapprove...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2CONS;Denounce the Three-Chapters!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6000001;The Second Council of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6000001;In the Second Council of Constantinople, the Ecumenical Patriarch has decreed support for the Monophysite doctrines, and publicly denounce the Nestorian Three-Chapters. This monumental theological shift may have dangerous consequences once news reaches the Papacy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB6000001;An interesting development...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC6000001;He has no right!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6000003;The Second Council of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6000003;In the Second Council of Constantinople, the Ecumenial Patriarch has attempted to appease both the Nestorian and the Monophysite faiths. Unfortunately, the religious leaders descended into theological fighting. It seems that both sides are no closer to a solution than before.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6000003;Pathetic...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD6000001;Pathetic...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6000001;Fantastic!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6000004;The Great Schism;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6000004;When new got to Rome of the Second Council of Constantinople, the Pope was outraged. He publicly denied the theological changes, and demanded the council nullified. In response the Ecumenical Patriarch and the Pope excommunicated each other. Now, it seems the 2 churches are now divided, and each ruler must decide the path to take for their people.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6000004;For the Patriarch!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB6000004;For the Pope!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6000005;The Pope Responds;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6000005;The Pope in Rome has agreed to accept the Changes made in the Second Council of Constantinople. With the joining of the Monophysites, it appears that this has been a success.;;;;;;;;;;;x

WtWSMS_flavour.1.desc;Two men come into your court, shouting and yelling. Upon questioning, they claim to be brothers, and their father had recently died. The eldest claim that their father's breastplate is rightfully his as the eldest, where the youngest says he needs it due to an oath to avenge his father. Though inheritance would pass it to the eldest, Thuringian tribal law states that the breastplate of a family member must pass to the avenger. To give the breastplate to the eldest would make you seem progressive to foreign powers, but the peasants may not be happy.;;;;;;;;;;;x

WtWSMS_flavour.8.desc;Two Frisians were brought into court today, but a problem was found. Frisian Tribal Law is different for West and East Frisians.

WtWSMS_flavour.9.desc;A man has accused another man of stealing his property. Frisian law contains a comprehensive list of wergelds, and holds the division of the four legal classes.

EVTDESC_ROM_1150;The Visigoths of the Garonne valley, who have been rapidly Romanized in the past centuries, no longer maintain a position as the dominant class under foreign rule. With no differences in social and political class separating them from their fellow latin-speaking ilk, the Visigoths of Gaul are beginning to melt into the rest of the Romano-Gallic population.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_1150;Good riddance. These lands will never be theirs again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ROM_1150;Even the peasants feel the pull of Roman civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_2000;With the Visigoths embracing the Nicene faith, the remaining minor differences between the Gothic ruling social class and the Hispani peasants and nobles are fading away. Both groups are starting to consider themselves one-and-the-same in this province, where they have embraced a united identity as the gens of the Rex Gothorum.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_2000;Let us embrace the unifying cultural identity!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ROM_2000;NO. We will never merge with these peasants in name or custom...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_2001;With native Celt-iberian rule long gone, the remaining Celts are starting to assimilate with their Romano-Hispanic neighbors, adopting their tongue and customs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_2001;And the tongue spoken by the peasants concerns me how, herald?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_2048;With native Celtic rule long gone, the remaining Gauls are starting to assimilate with their Romano-Gallic neighbors, adopting their tongue and customs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_2048;...And these peasant matters concern me how, again?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_2100;The latin vulgarate and customs of the peasants of this province have diverged enough from those of their distant neighbors. This province has become Catalan.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_2100;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ROM_2100;An interesting development...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_2200;The latin vulgarate and customs of the peasants of this province have diverged enough from those of their distant neighbors. This province has become Portuguese.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ROM_2200;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_2300;The latin vulgarate and customs of the peasants of this province have diverged enough from those of their distant neighbors. This province has become Castillian.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_2300;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ROM_2300;An interesting development...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_2400;The latin vulgarate and customs of the peasants of this province have diverged enough from those of their distant neighbors. This province has become Leonese.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_2400;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ROM_2400;An interesting development...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_2500;With their subjugation at the hands of the Arabs, the Romantic peoples of Spain are quickly being to influence and be influenced by their new-found rulers. A new Andalusian culture has become to emerge in this province.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_2500;The best aspects of both!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ROM_2500;Intriguing...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_3000;With many years having past since the fall of Rome in the West, the people of Italy have moved away from identifying solely with their Roman heritage much as their dialect of latin vulgarate has moved from its classical forebear. The people of Italy are becoming Italian.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_3000;Peasant matters are still peasant matters...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ROM_3000;It is good to see the peasants embracing the times.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CELT_1000;The Picts of Scotland have slowly been gaelicized under Irish rule, with a new culture identity uniting the Gaels and Picts of Caledonia. The people of this province have become Scottish.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CELT_1000;An interesting development!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CELT_1000;I'm starting to take to their strange ways too...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CELT_1100;Although the Armoricans have long held cultural ties with the Celts of the isles, the increasing influence of the Briton ruling class and Briton migrants has lead to the emergence of a new, mixed culture in Armorica. The people of this province have become Bretons.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CELT_1100;Let us embrace these new ways.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CELT_1100;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_CELT_1100;Peasant matters are not worth my time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
