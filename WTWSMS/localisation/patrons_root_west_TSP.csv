"PATRON_ROOT_WEST_SELECT_TSP;There are two great beings in the Root West faith. Each represent a core demographic of the faith: the Great Crane embodies the Blackheaded, the priests who intercede on our behalf. The Monkeys represent both the Redfaced- me and my fellow rulers -and the common man; it is from them that my right and power to rule descends. Either would be meaningful to myself and my people. Whom should I serve?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x"
