FEELSGOODMAN2;As you travel the realm, you are approached by a priest who asks you to join him to travel to a local shrine of the Kek cult. Kek, the Bringer of Light, is your frog-headed god of chaos, the time right before the dawn, and both darkness and its end. /n /n"Kek has spoken to me. He wants you to come and see his shrine and pay your respects to the Bringer of Light.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FEELSGOODMAN_YES;Your servant kneels before the altar of Kek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FEELSGOODMAN_NO;No, I don't have the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FEELSGOODMAN4;Standing Before the Bringer of Light;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FEELSGOODMAN5;All is quiet in the night. Before you is a small pond, and in front of this pond is a small stone altar. You hear the peaceful sound of croaking frogs, and it calms you. A statue of Kek sits atop the podium, surrounded by smaller statuettes of frogs wearing the Nemes. The priest turns to you. /n /n"In the primordial concept of darkness, the great Kek embodies the time right before the dawn. He is our Bringer of Light. Unlike the Abrahamic heathens, we know that darkness is not an entity to be feared, for Kek loves us. Without chaos, there is no order. Kek, though darkness he is, trumps it and in so doing brings light." /n /n"Please kneel with me and pay your respects to the holiest of frogs.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FEELSGOODMAN6;PRAISE KEK!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ONWARDS_TO_KEK;You agree and follow the priest to the local Kek shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
