society_whoreborites;Borborite Sect;;;;;;;;;;;x
borborites_DESC;The Borborites (an exonym literally meaning "the filthy ones") were a minor, polytheistic, Gnostic sect present in Upper Egypt in the fourth and fifth centuries AD. They preferred to call themselves "Koddians", "Phibionites", or "Barbeloites". Highly sexual in nature, they embraced peculiar rites involving soaking one's hands in menstrual blood and semen, and considered lovemaking an act of worship, engaging in many sex rituals with multiple women. Their version of the Eucharist/Sacraments involved consumption of the same. The Borborites possessed certain sacred books, one called Noria, a Gospel of Eve, Books of Seth, and the Revelations of Adam. They used both the Old and New Testament, but did not acknowledge the God of the Old Testament as the supreme deity. They taught that there were eight heavens, each under a separate Archon. In the seventh reigned Sabaoth, creator of heaven and earth, the God of the Jews, represented by some Borborites under the form of a donkey or a hog, hence the Jewish prohibition of swine's flesh. In the eighth heaven reigned Barbelo, the mother of the living, the Father of All, the supreme God, and Jesus the Christ. They denied that Christ was born of Mary, or had a real Body, and they also deny the resurrection of that Body. They believed that the human soul after death wanders through the seven heavens, until it obtains rest with Barbelo. According to Augustine they taught that the soul was derived from the substance of God, and hence could not be polluted by contact with matter. A subset of this sect is said to have consumed stillborn human fetuses- ritual cannibalism -that were conceived during their sacred sex rituals, making the entire sect a victim of fierce persecution. During the timeline of this Mod, they were wholly underground and near extinction.;;;;;;;;;;;x

1_800_choke_dat_ho_desc;Our holy shrines and sacred sites are home to many enlightened women who are in the process of attaining Gnosis. As a Barbeloite, I have a duty to glorify and worship Sabaoth through sacred lovemaking and consumption of menstrual blood and seed. I shall go to the shrine and select a concubine for worship.;;;;;;;;;;;x

whorewhoreborites1;Clergy Harem;;;;;;;;;;;x
whorewhoreborites1_desc;The most important rites of the Borborite faith are the sexual rituals. Here, in this holy sanctum, the primary purpose of the Borborite clergy takes place, and then some. With the help of the laity and tourists looking for some action, sacred semen and menstrual blood are collected here and stored for use and consumption in the Eucharist.;;;;;;;;;;;x
whorewhoreborites2;Holy Whorehouse;;;;;;;;;;;x
whorewhoreborites2_desc;With great investment, the small shrine for temple prostitution has greatly expanded, and is now a fully functional wing of the temple. Rooms for shrine prostitutes and dedicated lovemaking rooms are now in place, and the collection of sacred semen and menstrual fluids for consumption has been streamlined. The clergy are certainly busy "producing" these vital sacraments, and certainly, tourists and the laity are helping!;;;;;;;;;;;x
whorewhoreborites3;Sacred Brothel;;;;;;;;;;;x
whorewhoreborites3_desc;Thanks to the devotion and dedication of the faithful Borborites, the holy brothel has expanded into a full-fledged town in and around the church, with shrine prostitutes and clergy administrators wandering about, dedicated to the mass production of sacred menstrual fluids and holy semen for consumption in the Eucharist, and then some.;;;;;;;;;;;x
whoreborite;Borborite;;;;;;;;;;;x
whoreborite_desc;This character is a practicing Borborite, a member of a libertine Gnostic sect that considered love making an act of worship and engaged in ritual consumption of menstrual blood and semen. Borborites are peacible and prefer to be left alone. Needless to say, this isn't that popular outside the Borborite faith.;;;;;;;;;;;x
