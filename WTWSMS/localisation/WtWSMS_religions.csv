paulican_DESC;The Paulicians were a Christian Adoptionist sect, also accused by medieval sources of being Gnostic and quasi Manichaean Christian. They flourished between 650 and 872 in Armenia and the Eastern Themes of the Byzantine Empire. According to medieval Byzantine sources, the group's name was derived from the 3rd century Bishop of Antioch, Paul of Samosata.;;;;;;;;;;;x

total_depravity;Total Depravity;;;;;;;;;;;x
total_depravity_DESC;Total depravity is a theological doctrine derived from the Augustinian concept of original sin. It is the teaching that, as a consequence of the Fall of Man, every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of sin and, apart from the efficacious or prevenient grace of God, is utterly unable to choose to follow God, refrain from evil, or accept the gift of salvation as it is offered.;;;;;;;;;;;x

binitarian_DESC;Binitarianism is a Christian theology of duality, two personae, two individuals, or two aspects in one Godhead (or God). Classically, binitarianism is understood as a form of monotheism — that is, that God is an absolutely single being, and yet with binitarianism there is a "twoness" in God. The other common forms of monotheism are "unitarianism", a belief in a single God with one aspect, and "trinitarianism", a belief in a single God with three aspects.;;;;;;;;;;;x

pelagianism;Pelagian;;;;;;;;;;;x
pelagianism_DESC;Pelagianism is the belief that original sin did not taint human nature and that mortal will is still capable of choosing good or evil without special Divine aid. This is still sometimes called Limited Depravity. Thus, in contrast to 1 Corinthians 15:19-22, Adam's sin was "to set a bad example" for his progeny, but his actions did not have the other consequences imputed to original sin. Pelagianism views the role of Jesus as "setting a good example" for the rest of humanity as well as providing an atonement for our sins. In short, humanity has full control, and thus full responsibility, for obeying the Gospel in addition to full responsibility for every sin. According to Pelagian doctrine, because humans are sinners by choice, they are therefore criminals who need the atonement of Jesus Christ. Sinners are not victims, they are criminals who need pardon.;;;;;;;;;;;x
antinomianism;Antinomian;;;;;;;;;;;x
antinomianism_DESC;Any view which holds that Christians are freed by grace from obligations of any moral law, and thus can sin at will if they ask for forgiveness. Saint Paul had to refute a charge of this type made by opponents because of his attitude to the Mosaic Law.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ebionites;Ebionite;;;;;;;;;;;x
ebionites_DESC;Ebionites, or Ebionaioi, is a patristic term referring to a Jewish Christian movement that existed during the early centuries of the Christian Era. They regarded Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah while rejecting his divinity and insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites. The Ebionites used only one of the Jewish Gospels, revered James the Just and rejected Paul of Tarsus as an apostate from the Law. Their name suggests that they placed a special value on voluntary poverty. They have been identified as the meek and the poor Jesus spoke of in the Beatitudes, and the Ebionim was one of the terms used by the sect that sought to separate themselves from the corruption of the Temple, at Qumran, whom many believe were the Essenes.;;;;;;;;;;;x

marcionism;Marcionist;;;;;;;;;;;x
marcionism_DESC;Marcionism was an Early Christian dualist belief system that originated in the teachings of Marcion of Sinope at Rome around the year 144 AD. Marcion believed Jesus Christ was the savior sent by God, and Paul of Tarsus was his chief apostle, but he rejected the Hebrew Bible and the God of Israel. Marcionists believed that the wrathful Hebrew God was a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament. This belief was in some ways similar to Gnostic Christian theology. Notably, both are dualistic, that is, they posit opposing gods, forces, or principles: one higher, spiritual, and "good", and the other lower, material, and "evil" (compare Manichaeism), in contrast to the orthodox Christian view that "evil" has no independent existence, but is a privation or lack of "good", a view shared by the Jewish theologian Moses Maimonides.;;;;;;;;;;;x

valentinianism_DESC;Valentinus and the Gnostic movement that bore his name were considered threats to Christianity by church leaders and Christian scholars, not only because of their influence, but also because of their doctrine, practices and beliefs. Gnostics were condemned as heretics, and prominent Church fathers such as Irenaeus of Lyons and Hippolytus of Rome wrote against Gnosticism. Most evidence for the Valentinian theory comes from its critics and detractors, most notably Irenaeus, since he was especially concerned with refuting Valentinianism.;;;;;;;;;;;x

donatism_DESC;Donatists were rigorists, holding that the church must be a church of "saints," not "sinners," and that sacraments, such as baptism, administered by traditores were invalid. Probably in 311, a new bishop of Carthage, Caecilian, was consecrated by someone who had allegedly been a traditor, Felix of Aptungi, his opponents consecrated a short-lived rival, who was succeeded by Donatus, after whom the schism was named.

sethian;Sethian;;;;;;;;;;;x
sethian_DESC;Sethianism is a polytheistic, ancient Gnostic system revering Seth, son of Adam, and Sophia, goddess of wisdom, as divine incarnations. Sethians believe in a "backstory" to the Book of Genesis, in which an evil force called Yaldabaoth and his henchmen, the Archons, spawned Creation, in imitation of a perfect spiritual world under the True Unknown God. Yaldabaoth did this, Sethians say, by stealing the Power of the mother goddess, Sophia (meaning "wisdom"), whose Power Yaldabaoth accidently transferred into humanity, which he then removed from them by torment. The Power was transferred into the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. They hold the belief that the snake in the Garden of Eden was an agent of the true God and brought knowledge of truth to man via the Fall of Man in defiance of Yaldabaoth's order, which they see as the beginning of humanity's liberation from Yaldabaoth's tyranny.;;;;;;;;;;;x

insular;Insular;;;;;;;;;;;x
insular_DESC;In the British Isles there were a distinct number of practices and traditions that made Jesus' Brythonic and Gaelic followers different to their continental contemporaries. These include a distinctive system for determining the dating of Easter, a style of monastic tonsure,  a unique system of penance, and the popularity of going into "exile for Christ". The monasteries that were founded in the most wild and secluded places of the British Isles produced some of the greatest works of art ever to honour God's name and their saints went on to spread the Gospel from the Alpine slopes of St Gallen and Salzburg to the frigid isolation of the Faroe Islands and Iceland. After the Synod of Whitby or Streanœhealh in 664 these traditions began to decline as Britannia's, Hibernia's and Caledonia's Christians practiced the rites of Rome more than their own traditions. Yet their spiritualism and artwork always left a distinctive mark on the inhabitants of the British Isles. In the mod, they are a separate branch of Christianity, and may have church councils fire with the Nicene church. ;;;;;;;;;;;x

abadites_DESC;Abadites or Ibadites are a Moslem sect named after its founder Jaber Ibn Zayd. The Abadites still have a small number of followers in Oman, the island of Djerba, Tripolitania, Tunis and Algeria. Around the middle of the 8th century the Abadite missionary 'Abdullah ibn-Yahya, called Talib al-Haqq (The Seeker after Right), set out from Basrah, began preaching in Yemen and built up a kind of theocratic dominion all over south-west Arabia. In spite of various vicissitudes and suppression the Abadite imams succeeded in maintaining their power for some 900 years. The descendants of the few who could escape into the secluded valleys of the Hadramawt have remained faithful to their creed down to this day. Notwithstanding their wide dispersion the various Abadite groups show a remarkable coherence.;;;;;;;;;;;x
quamatian;Quamatian;;;;;;;;;;;x
quamatian_DESC;The Qarmatians were a syncretic religious group that combined elements of the Shi'a Ismaili branch of Islam with Persian mysticism centered in eastern Arabia, where they attempted to establish a utopian republic in 899 CE. They are most famed for their revolt against the Abbasid Caliphate. Mecca was sacked by the sect’s leader Ahir Sulayman, outraging the Muslim world, particularly with their theft of the Black Stone and desecration of the Well of Zamzam with corpses during the Hajj season of 930 CE. The Qarami?ah were also known as "the Greengrocers" because of their strict vegetarian habits.;;;;;;;;;;;x

twelver;Twelver;;;;;;;;;;;x
twelver_DESC;Twelver Shia or the Ithna'ashariyyah' is the largest branch of Shia Islam, and it will become the main branch of the religion is the future. The term Twelver is derived from the doctrine of believing in twelve divinely ordained leaders, known as The Twelve Imams.

Over time, the teachings of Ismailism further transformed into the belief system as it is known today, with an explicit concentration on the deeper, esoteric meaning (ba?in) of the faith. With the eventual development of Twelverism into the more literalistic (zahir) oriented Akhbari and later Usuli schools of thought, Shiaism developed in two separate directions: the metaphorical Ismailli group focusing on the mystical path and nature of God and the divine manifestation in the personage of the "Imam of the Time" as the "Face of God", with the more literalistic Twelver group focusing on divine law and the deeds and sayings Muhammad and his successors, who as A'immah were guides and a light to God.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Zaydis believe that on the last hour of Zayd ibn Ali, he was betrayed by the people in Kufa who said to him: "May God have mercy on you! What do you have to say on the matter of Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab?" Zayd ibn Ali said, "I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them...when they were entrusted with government they behaved justly with the people and acted according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah.". Since Imam Jafar al-Sadiq, Imam Zayd ibn Ali, Imams Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik ibn Anas worked together in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina along with over 70 other leading jurists and scholars. And Imam Jafar al-Sadiq and Imam Zayd ibn Ali did not them selves write any books.;;;;;;;;;;;x

thracian_pagan_DESC;Thracian Paganism is an old faith, distinct from Hellenism and Eastern Faiths. Containing a diverse pantheon of gods, the most important was the God Hero, who was the only universal Thracian deity. Thracian faith remained strong in Thrace until the arrival of the cult of Dionysus.;;;;;;;;;;;x
thracian_pagan_desc;As far as their religion is concerned, part of the Thracians practiced the so-called Thracian Orphism - a teaching related to the cult of Orpheus and followed by the aristocracy, organized in mysterious male societies. In the roots of Thracian Orphism stood the idea of self-perfection and the system functioned on two levels: aristocratic (doctrinal) and popular (social). The aristocratic level concerned those initiated into the secret knowledge of the teaching, while the popular level was connected with people familiar with the teaching but not initiated in it. Thracian Orphism combined the cult of the Earth and the cult of the Sun, personified by Orpheus and Zalmoxis. According to the cosmological model of Thracian Orphism, the world is structured in a seven or ten-stage cycle.;;;;;;;;;;;x

isiac_pagan_DESC;The Isiac faith is the worship of Isis instituted by Emperor Caligula in the later Roman Empire. The Isis cult and its simple rites took hold in the ancient world and the religion of Isis spread throughout the Roman Empire during the formative centuries of Christianity. Wall paintings and objects reveal her pervasive presence at Pompeii, preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE. In Rome, temples were built and obelisks erected in her honour. In Greece, the cult of Isis was introduced to traditional centres of worship in Delos, Delphi, Eleusis and Athens, as well as in northern Greece. Harbours of Isis were to be found on the Arabian Sea and the Black Sea. Inscriptions show followers in Gaul, Spain, Pannonia, Germany, Arabia, Asia Minor, Portugal and many shrines even in Britain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
priscillianism;Priscillianist;;;;;;;;;;;x
priscillianism_DESC;The foundation of the doctrines of the Priscillianists was Gnostic-Manichaean dualism, a belief in the existence of two kingdoms, one of Light and one of Darkness. Angels and the souls of men were said to be severed from the substance of the Deity. Human souls were intended to conquer the Kingdom of Darkness, but fell and were imprisoned in material bodies. Thus both kingdoms were represented in man, and hence a conflict symbolized on the side of Light by the Twelve Patriarchs, heavenly spirits, who corresponded to certain of man's powers, and on the side of Darkness by the Signs of the Zodiac, the symbols of matter and the lower kingdom. The salvation of man consists in liberation from the domination of matter. The twelve heavenly spirits having failed to accomplish their release, the Saviour came in a heavenly body which appeared to be like that of other men, and through His doctrine and His apparent death released the souls of the men from the influence of earthly matter.;;;;;;;;;;;x
gnostic;Gnostic;;;;;;;;;;;x
gnostic_DESC;Gnosticism refers to a diverse, syncretistic religious movement consisting of various belief systems generally united in the teaching that humans are divine souls trapped in a material world created by an imperfect god, the demiurge, who is frequently identified with the Abrahamic God. Gnosticism is a rejection (sometimes from an ascetic perspective) and vilification of the human body and of the material world or cosmos. Gnosticism teaches duality in Material (Matter) versus Spiritual or Body (evil) versus Soul (good). Gnosticism teaches that the natural or material world will and should be destroyed (total annihilation) by the true spiritual God in order to free mankind from the reign of the false God or Demiurge.;;;;;;;;;;;x

mithraic_pagan_DESC;The Mithraic Mysteries were a mystery religion practiced in the Roman Empire from about the 1st to 4th centuries AD. The name of the Persian god Mithra, adapted into Greek as Mithras, was linked to a new and distinctive imagery. Writers of the Roman Empire period referred to this mystery religion by phrases which can be anglicized as Mysteries of Mithras or Mysteries of the Persians. The mysteries were popular in the Roman military. Worshipers of Mithras had a complex system of seven grades of initiation, with ritual meals. Initiates called themselves syndexioi, those "united by the handshake". They met in underground temples, which survive in large numbers. The cult appears to have had its centre in Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;x

root_west_pagan_DESC;The Root West religion is an ancient, shamanistic faith native to the Tangut peoples. While some Tanguts converted to Buddhism over time, many rural Tanguts clinged to this ancient religion devoted to the worship of cranes and monkeys. Root West rulers are called 'The Red Faced' or 'Redface', and are believed to descend from monkeys, or to have been granted the right to rule by them. Root West clergymen are called the Black Headed, due to their black robes and black felt hats. They perform an intercessory role between the Red Faced and the gods and exercise control over over the people faith's orthodoxy.;;;;;;;;;;x

root_west_pagan_reformed_DESC;After centuries of syncretization and being eaten away by the Buddhist faith, a charismatic Redface has united the disparate Root West shamans under one authority! Worship of cranes and monkeys, use and depiction of clergy vestments, and other aspects of faith have been standardized, and the myriad of musicals, sonnets, and odes of worship, along with the defenitive Great Ode, have been combined into one universal hymnal. A central liturgy now exists for each holy animal and sacrament. The powerful Black Headed clergy have always exercised intercession and excommunication duties among Root West settlements, but now a centralized Black Intercessor excercises authority over all the Redfaced and worshippers everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;x
