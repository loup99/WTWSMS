# Everyone I spoke to agreed that the Borborites would make a great Society. The Borborites were very public about their views and they actively prolestyzed, but by the timeline of the Mod, they were underground and dying off. I do not have the coding skills to write a Secret Society with a religion that was totally underground at this time. #
# The reason I still want the Borborites in the Mod as their own religion is because I intend for the religion to be a Secret Society that STARTS underground. You, as the player, have to be of an open Gnostic religion that linked to the Borborites, or of a denomination or doctrine that allows for and/or encourages sexual sin, in order to join. However, you cannot become a Borborite through the normal means of becoming a heresy. The Borborite religion will start as its own seaprate branch (like Georgian Orthodoxy does), making it impossible for the player to become it outside of the Society. However, if you restore it, it becomes a heresy of the Nicine Church, like all other Gnostics. #
# Restored Borborites can construct the special Borborite Buildings and use other content I made in TurtleShroom Productions V and VI. Society members can only access the recruiting of a shrine prostitute Decision and engage in Borborite rituals. #
